# Box Shooter : FPS Challenge - Unreal Engine 5.6
---

## Overview

This project is a first-person shooter (FPS) game developed in **Unreal Engine 5.6**. The gameplay revolves around dynamically spawning interactive boxes based on real-time data fetched from an online JSON endpoint. Players engage by shooting and damaging these boxes, earning points upon destruction, which are displayed on a custom in-game UI.

This assignment focuses on demonstrating **Unreal Engine C++ proficiency** in areas such as online data fetching, JSON parsing, dynamic actor spawning, custom material application, hit detection, and UMG UI integration.


## Features

- Spawns Boxes from Online Data: The game connects to the internet to get details (like color, health, and points) for the boxes it needs to create.
- Boxes to Shoot: The boxes appear in the game. You can shoot them to reduce their health. A health widget is displayed to show their health.
- Changes Color: The boxes have different colors based on the information from the internet.
- Score Points: When a box's health reaches zero, it breaks, and you get points.
- Shows Your Score: Current score is always visible on the screen.

## Technical Logic & Implementation Notes

### Data Fetching & Box Spawning
- **HTTP Requests:** Utilizes Unreal Engine's native HTTP Module to get requests to retrieve the JSON data from the URL.
- **JSON Parsing:** Parse the incoming JSON string into Unreal data types. This data then sets the properties of each spawned box.
* **Box Actor:** Upon parsing, instances of this actor are spawned with their properties (type, color, health, score) initialized from the JSON data.

### Interaction & UI
- **Shooting:** using Unrealâ€™s projectile movement component to shoot the boxes
- **Damage & Score:** When a projectile hits a box, its health is decremented. If health reaches zero, the box is destroyed, and the player's score is updated.
- **Score UI:** A Widget manages the score display, updating on screen whenever the player's score changes.
